Fiji-CMTK-registration-runner-GUI
Cross-platform Fiji-Imagej macro GUI to run CMTK-Munger image registration (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk/) . You can pass arguments to the script interactively, several registration instances can be started up after each other. 
The script will run on any generic pc from the last ten years I even tested it on a 8 year old thinkpad with acceptable performance. Works on Debian/Ubuntu, Windows 10 with WSL  and macOS

Test data  available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n866kvoakscig4i/AAB-m1WzqgpkEwk5PV5vMbzEa?dl=0

-The right registration library structure is generated automatically, no need of copying around files

-All parameters can be set interactively, you don't have to worry about syntax

-The script is very simple just under 100 lines and written in Imagej script language, easy to understand and modify, especially adding imagej functions

## Linux install

1. Install is fully automated (including CMTK and fiji),  if you don’t have Fiji, the installer will set one up for you. Simply run the  "linux_install.sh" bash file in the terminal. One way to do this is to download or clone the repo https://github.com/sandorbx/Fiji-CMTK-registration-runner-GUI.git. Extract the files if needed, right click on the folder and choose the "open terminal here" option, type in the terminal:  `bash linux_install.sh`

3. If you need test data download this : https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n866kvoakscig4i/AAB-m1WzqgpkEwk5PV5vMbzEa?dl=0

4. In Fiji you can launch the registration GUI from the menu:  plugins>macros>Fiji CMTK registration runner GUI

## User Guide:

• for cmtk library with munger browse for the location in your fiji folder Fiji.app/lib/cmtk_munger_wsl_linux

• Very important to avoid any spaces or special characters in your files and folders names

• your data, refbrain and working directory can be wherever on your windows drives, you can browse for them from the gui, they will be in /mnt , (for example to go to your windows desktop folder /mnt/c/users/username/desktop)

• make sure that none of the file or directory names containing spaces

• registration directory with the right structure will be generated automatically and the script copies there your images to register 

• almost everything is automatic the only prequisite that your images to register has to be contained in a separate folder  and named by adding a number indicating the channel in the end of the filename separated by and underscore (yourpicturename_01;yourpicturename_02 and so on)

• You can choose whether the script should clean up after itself and just keep the reformatted images with the log. Be mindful when you specify the paths to files and         folders(refbrain, reg dir, images)

• Set your parameters, if you click ok the registration script starts and the GUI will close, Fiji will display a log, in case you want to follow the progress of the actual commands in detail, open a task manager program.
